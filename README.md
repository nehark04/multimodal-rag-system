# BTT-Anote-1B - Project Overview

# Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
This project is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of multimodal data processing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Python. The primary goal is to capture and process different types of data—audio, image, text, and video—convert these into text-based representations, and use a RAG model to query across all modalities to generate insightful responses. This project provides hands-on experience in data processing, model integration, and the practical application of RAG.

## Learning Objectives
- **Skills and Concepts**: Students will learn how to process and analyze different types of data (audio, image, text, video) using Python. They will also gain experience in converting non-text data into textual representations and integrating these into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to generate responses based on multimodal inputs.
- **Project Goals**: By the end of this project, students should be able to:
  - Capture and process live audio and video data.
  - Convert audio, image, and video data into text-based representations.
  - Implement a basic RAG pipeline to query and generate responses using multimodal data.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Whisper**: A powerful speech-to-text model from OpenAI that is well-suited for handling real-world audio with varying levels of noise and different languages or accents.
- **OpenCV**: A versatile library for image and video processing, allowing for tasks like capturing data from cameras, performing object detection, and manipulating video frames.
- **TorchVision**: A library in PyTorch that includes pre-trained models and tools for processing images and videos, particularly useful for tasks like object detection.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: A leading library for natural language processing that provides tools for implementing RAG models, enabling text retrieval and generation capabilities.

## Project Structure

### Stage 1: Environment Setup
**Objective**: Set up the Python environment and install all necessary libraries to handle and process multimodal data.

**Steps**:
1. **Virtual Environment**: Create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure an isolated project environment.
2. **Installations**: Install libraries such as PyTorch, OpenCV, Whisper, and Transformers to support multimodal data processing and model implementation.

**Expected Outcome**: A fully configured Python environment ready for processing multimodal data and implementing a RAG system.

### Stage 2: Audio Processing and Conversion to Text (Whisper)
**Objective**: Capture live audio input, convert it to text using Whisper, and prepare the text data for integration into the RAG pipeline.

**Steps**:
1. **Audio Capture**: Set up a Python script to capture audio from the microphone. This audio will be saved in a WAV format for processing.
2. **Whisper Integration**: Use Whisper to transcribe the captured audio into text. Whisper's capabilities make it ideal for converting spoken language into text, even in noisy environments.

**Test Case**:
- **Input**: A 10-second audio clip with a spoken phrase, e.g., “Describe the scene in the video.”
- **Expected Output**: A text transcription such as “Describe the scene in the video.”

**Expected Outcome**: A text transcription of the audio that can be used alongside other data types in the RAG pipeline.

### Stage 3: Image Processing and Conversion to Text
**Objective**: Capture or load images, perform object detection, and convert the detected objects into text descriptions for use in the RAG pipeline.

**Steps**:
1. **Image Capture**: Use OpenCV to capture images from a webcam or load existing images from a file.
2. **Object Detection**: Apply a pre-trained object detection model, such as Faster R-CNN from TorchVision, to identify objects within the images.
3. **Text Conversion**: Convert the detected objects into text descriptions, including object names and confidence scores.

**Test Case**:
- **Input**: An image with multiple objects, such as a table with a laptop and a coffee cup.
- **Expected Output**: A text description such as “Detected objects: laptop (confidence: 0.95), coffee cup (confidence: 0.88).”

**Expected Outcome**: Text descriptions of objects detected in images, formatted for integration into the RAG system.

### Stage 4: Video Processing and Conversion to Text
**Objective**: Capture video, extract key frames, perform object detection on these frames, and convert the results into text descriptions.

**Steps**:
1. **Video Capture**: Use OpenCV to capture video from a webcam or load a video file. Save the video in a standard format (e.g., AVI).
2. **Frame Extraction**: Extract key frames from the video at regular intervals to represent different moments in the video.
3. **Object Detection**: Perform object detection on each key frame and convert the detected objects into text descriptions.

**Test Case**:
- **Input**: A 10-second video showing a person entering a room and sitting at a desk.
- **Expected Output**: A series of text descriptions, such as “Frame 1: Detected person (confidence: 0.92), chair (confidence: 0.85), desk (confidence: 0.88). Frame 2: Detected person (confidence: 0.94), sitting on chair.”

**Expected Outcome**: A series of text descriptions representing the content of the video, which can be queried along with other modalities in the RAG pipeline.

### Stage 5: Text Data Integration and Retrieval
**Objective**: Retrieve and process text data from all modalities (audio, image, video) and integrate it for use in the RAG pipeline.

**Steps**:
1. **Text Retrieval**: Use a pre-trained text retrieval model, such as Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), to search and retrieve relevant text data based on a query.
2. **Integration**: Combine all retrieved text data into a single context that can be used as input for the RAG model.

**Test Case**:
- **Input**: A query such as “What objects are present in the video and audio?”
- **Expected Output**: A combined text context that includes information retrieved from all the modalities, like “The video shows a person sitting at a desk, with a laptop and a coffee cup. The audio describes the scene as a quiet room.”

**Expected Outcome**: A unified text context that integrates information from all modalities, ready for input into the RAG model.

### Stage 6: Basic RAG Pipeline Implementation
**Objective**: Implement a simple RAG pipeline that queries the combined multimodal text data and generates contextually relevant responses.

**Steps**:
1. **RAG Model Setup**: Load and configure a pre-trained RAG model using the Transformers library. The RAG model will be used to process the combined text context and generate responses.
2. **Query Processing**: Input a query into the RAG model, using the integrated text from all modalities as context.
3. **Response Generation**: Generate and display the response from the RAG model, demonstrating how the integrated data enhances the relevance and quality of the output.

**Test Case**:
- **Input**: A query such as “What is happening in the video and audio?”
- **Expected Output**: A generated response like “The video shows a person entering the room and sitting at a desk. The audio mentions a quiet room.”

**Expected Outcome**: A functional RAG system capable of generating meaningful responses by processing and querying data from multiple sources.

## Outcome
By the end of this project, students will have developed a Python-based system capable of capturing, processing, and querying multimodal data. They will gain experience in converting various data types to text, integrating these into a unified context, and using a RAG model to generate insightful responses. This project serves as a hands-on introduction to multimodal data processing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, laying the groundwork for more advanced applications in this field.

## Glossary of Terms
